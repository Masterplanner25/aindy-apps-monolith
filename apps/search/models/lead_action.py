"""
LEAD ACTION MODEL
------------------------------------
Part of: A.I.N.D.Y. – Search Execution Layer

The Execution Layer is the act-on-insight half Search was missing: the leadgen
pipeline discovered and scored leads (``LeadGenResult``) but nothing ever acted on
them. A ``LeadAction`` is that acted-upon artifact — one tracked, revertible row per
lead the guarded consumer decides to pursue, carrying the generated outreach draft
and the decision that qualified it.

Safe by construction: the default ``draft`` channel never contacts the lead — it
produces a draft for review and (via the search public surface) for freelance to
convert into a client/order. A real send channel is gated default-off.
