"""
Three-axis composition — the *advisory* blend (three-axis model, Phase C).

Phase A measured the axes; Phase B shadow-logged them; Phase C is the first phase where the
Worth and Trajectory axes are allowed to *move* the canonical ``master_score`` — but only
when ``AINDY_INFINITY_THREE_AXIS_ADVISORY`` is on (default off), and only within bounded,
reversible weight clamps. The behavioral KPIs remain the anchor (≥ ``BEHAVIORAL_MIN_WEIGHT``
of the composite). See §8 of ``docs/architecture/INFINITY_SCORE_MODEL.md``.

Design decisions this module implements (all locked in §8):
  * **Worth source = declared prior only** — the advisory blend reads Worth from the
    declared-prior score (`compute_worth`); realized revenue stays observability-only.
  * **Volume consolidation** — `consolidate_volume` / `consolidated_weight_view` express how
    the three completion KPIs collapse into a single Volume axis. In Phase C this is the
    *tested migration path* surfaced for interpretability; it does not yet re-shape the
    persisted schema (that is Phase D). The advisory blend adds only Worth + Trajectory on
    top of the behavioral anchor, which already embodies volume via its completion KPIs — so
    completion is never double-counted.
  * **Conservative initial worth weight** — ~12% worth / ~8% trajectory by default,
    soak-tunable via env, so behavioral stays ≥ 80%.

**Graceful degradation is the crux.** Early deployments have no worth declarations and few
estimated tasks, so an axis often has *no data*. A naive blend would drag such a user's score
toward zero. Instead, a missing axis returns its reserved weight to the behavioral anchor —
a user with neither Worth nor Trajectory data scores exactly as they do today. The axes can
only *add* signal, never silently penalize its absence.
