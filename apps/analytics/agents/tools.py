"""Reasoning agent tool (ARM/Reasoning Phase 3 follow-up).

Exposes the autonomous-reasoning service to agents as the read-only
`reasoning.evaluate` tool, so an agent can ask "what should I do next?" mid-run.
Registered via the runtime's `register_tool` surface — no runtime edits. The
capability wiring lives in `capabilities.py` so plans using this tool resolve a
capability token and auto-approve at low risk.
