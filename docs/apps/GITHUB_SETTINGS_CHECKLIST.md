# Apps GitHub Settings Checklist

This document lists the manual GitHub UI settings that should be configured for
`aindy-apps-monolith`.

These settings are not stored in git and must be recreated in GitHub after the
repo split.

## Branch Baseline

Recommended baseline:

- default branch: `main`
- protect branch: `main`

The current apps workflow is designed around `push` and `pull_request` events
on `main`.

## Recommended Branch Protection

In GitHub:

- Settings -> Branches -> Add branch protection rule
- branch name pattern: `main`

Recommended protections:

- require a pull request before merging: enabled
- required approvals: `1`
- dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed: enabled
- require conversation resolution before merging: enabled
- require status checks to pass before merging: enabled
- restrict direct pushes to `main`: enabled

Recommended required status checks:

- `App Docs And Contract Checks`
- `App Contracts`
- `Frontend Unit Tests`
- `Frontend Build And Container Smoke`

Do **not** require any check that does not currently exist in
`.github/workflows/app-ci.yml`.

In particular, do **not** assume there is a default blocking Playwright job yet.

## Merge Policy

Recommended:

- allow squash merge: enabled
- allow merge commit: disabled
- allow rebase merge: optional, team preference

Reasoning:

- squash merge keeps app/bootstrap/frontend history easier to review
- merge commits are not required by the current apps repo workflow design

## Optional Stronger Settings

These are reasonable if the team wants stricter governance:

- require linear history: enabled
- require signed commits: enabled if the team already uses signed commits
- allow auto-merge: enabled
- automatically delete head branches: enabled
- require approval of the most recent reviewable push: enabled

Only enable these if they match how the team actually works.

## Actions / Workflow Settings

Recommended GitHub repo settings:

- GitHub Actions: enabled
- workflow permissions: read repository contents unless a future workflow needs
  write access
- fork pull request approval policy: set according to org policy

## Runtime Install Note

App CI installs `aindy-runtime` from PyPI as a normal pinned dependency, so no
runtime-checkout repository variable or secret is required. The former
`AINDY_RUNTIME_REPO` / `AINDY_RUNTIME_CHECKOUT_TOKEN` config (for the
pre-publication source checkout) is no longer used and can be removed if set.

## First-Run Note

GitHub only lets branch protection require status checks that have already run
at least once on the repository.

Recommended sequence:

1. push `.github/workflows/app-ci.yml` to `main`
2. let the workflow run successfully at least once
3. configure the required status checks listed above
