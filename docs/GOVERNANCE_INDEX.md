# Governance Index

Authoritative registry of documentation scope and authority for
`aindy-apps-monolith`. Defines the doc hierarchy, change protocol, and agent
obligations for this repo. Authored fresh during DOCS-MIGRATION-2 (the pre-split
monolith index was monolith-centric and referenced runtime-owned docs this repo
does not own).

This repo owns app domain code (`apps/<domain>/...`), the React client
(`client/`), the app plugin manifest, app-owned migrations, and the app docs
below. It does **not** own `AINDY/` — runtime contracts are *referenced* upstream
authority, not redefined here. See
[apps/RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY.md](./apps/RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY.md) and the runtime repo's
`docs/runtime/RUNTIME_DOCSET_BOUNDARY.md`.

## 1. Documentation Hierarchy

### Level 0 — Upstream runtime authority (referenced, owned by `aindy-runtime`)
App code and docs must conform to these and must not contradict or redefine them:
- Runtime Public API Contract — the only `AINDY.*` surface apps may import.
- Runtime DB Ownership Contract — runtime-owned vs app-owned tables/migrations.
- `RUNTIME_DOCSET_BOUNDARY.md` — the doc ownership map between the two repos.

### Level 1 — Repo operating instructions
- `CLAUDE.md` (repo root) — conventions, commands, and boundary rules that
  **override default agent behavior**. First read before any change.

### Level 2 — Architecture & integration contract (app-owned)
- `docs/platform/governance/INVARIANTS.md` — app-domain invariants (non-negotiable
  constraints enforced by `apps/`); runtime invariants are owned by `aindy-runtime`.
- `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md` — app architecture overview.
- `docs/architecture/PLUGIN_REGISTRY_PATTERN.md` — runtime↔app registration contract.
- `docs/architecture/BOOT_PROFILES.md` — boot profiles and manifest selection.
- `docs/architecture/CROSS_DOMAIN_COUPLING.md` — cross-domain dependency rules.
- `docs/apps/APPS_MONOLITH_REPO_SHAPE.md` — target repo shape.
- `docs/apps/RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY.md` — runtime dependency contract.
- `docs/apps/CLIENT_OWNERSHIP.md` — frontend ownership.

### Level 3 — Public surface & interface authority (app-owned)
- `docs/architecture/PUBLIC_SURFACE_CONTRACTS.md` — cross-domain public surfaces.
- `docs/architecture/PUBLIC_SURFACE_AUDIT.md`, `PUBLIC_SURFACE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`.
- `docs/platform/interfaces/API_CONTRACTS.md` — HTTP route inventory.
- `docs/api/API_REFERENCE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` — app REST surface + history.
- `docs/architecture/ANALYTICS_BOUNDARY.md` — analytics ownership boundary.
- `docs/architecture/USER_ID_AUDIT.md` — per-user scoping audit.

### Level 4 — Engineering & collaboration
- `docs/platform/engineering/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`
- `docs/deployment/MIGRATION_POLICY.md`
- `docs/apps/CI_OWNERSHIP.md`, `docs/apps/GITHUB_SETTINGS_CHECKLIST.md`
- `docs/apps/IMPLEMENTATION_DOCS_AUDIT.md`

### Level 5 — Evolution, risk & domain guides
- `TECH_DEBT.md` (repo root) — debt register.
- `docs/apps/EVOLUTION_PLAN.md` — phased app evolution roadmap.
- `LIVE_VERIFICATION_SCOPE.md` — live-stack verification scope.
- Domain guides under `docs/apps/`: `AGENTICS`, `AUTONOMOUS_REASONING_MODULE`,
  `INFINITY_ALGORITHM*`, `RIPPLETRACE`, `SEARCH_SYSTEM`, `SOCIAL_LAYER`,
  `FREELANCING_SYSTEM`, `ABSTRACTED_ALGORITHM_SPEC`,
  `FORMULA_AND_ALGORITHM_OVERVIEW`; `docs/apps/MASTERPLAN_SAAS.md`.

## 2. Authority Rules
- Upstream runtime contracts (Level 0) are authoritative; app docs may depend on
  them but must not redefine runtime ownership or imply app bootstrap is part of
  the runtime baseline.
- `CLAUDE.md` overrides default agent behavior within this repo.
- Import-boundary rules are **hard constraints**, enforced by CI:
  `AINDY/` must never import `apps.*`; apps reach `AINDY.*` only through declared
  public contracts; cross-app imports must be declared in `APP_DEPENDS_ON`. See
  `scripts/check_app_imports.py` and `tests/unit/test_import_boundaries.py`.
- No lower-level document may contradict a higher-level one. Conflict order:
  Level 0 → CLAUDE.md → architecture → interface → domain.

## 3. Change Protocol
A structural change must update the docs it affects, in the same change:
- App architecture change → `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md`.
- Registration/bootstrap change → `docs/architecture/PLUGIN_REGISTRY_PATTERN.md`.
- New/changed cross-domain coupling → `docs/architecture/CROSS_DOMAIN_COUPLING.md`
  and `PUBLIC_SURFACE_CONTRACTS.md`.
- Route behavior change → `docs/platform/interfaces/API_CONTRACTS.md`,
  `docs/api/API_REFERENCE.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` (breaking/additive).
- Schema/migration discipline change → `docs/deployment/MIGRATION_POLICY.md`.
- Test/validation discipline change → `docs/platform/engineering/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`.
- New deferred risk → `TECH_DEBT.md`.

## 4. Agent Interaction Protocol
AI agents working in this repo must:
- Read `CLAUDE.md` first; treat its instructions as overriding defaults.
- Treat the import-boundary rules (§2) as hard constraints and run
  `python scripts/check_app_imports.py` before proposing a PR.
- Consult the relevant domain guide before changing a domain's behavior.
- Treat `AINDY.*` as runtime-owned: import only documented public contracts;
  never add `apps.*` imports to runtime code.
- Verify claims on Linux CI — green local Windows runs do not prove integration.

## 5. Governance Stability Principle
- Documentation must reflect implementation reality.
- Docs are updated before or alongside the code change, not after.
- Documentation drift is technical debt and belongs in `TECH_DEBT.md`.

## 6. Entry Point
This file is the first document to read before architectural or cross-domain
modifications. For runtime behavior, defer to the runtime repo's authority docs.

## 7. Docs Changes Checklist
- Update `last_verified` in any doc you materially change.
- Ensure the change does not contradict a higher-level authority.
- Apply the §3 Change Protocol to related docs.
- For a new doc, add it to the appropriate Level above.

## 8. Doc Ownership
- Governance documents require explicit human sign-off by the project owner or
  designated maintainer.
- Designated maintainer: Shawn Knight.

## 9. Out of Scope (owned elsewhere)
- Runtime behavior, execution/retry semantics, memory bridge, syscalls,
  invariants, deployment model → `aindy-runtime` (`docs/runtime/`).
- The app evolution roadmap lives at `docs/apps/EVOLUTION_PLAN.md`
  (Level 5). Its Phase 1–4 runtime/platform hardening is owned upstream by
  `aindy-runtime` and retained there only as historical context.
