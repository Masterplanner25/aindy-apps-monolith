"""Verify the agent planner is wired end-to-end with the runtime_local backend.

This is the proof that "wiring the planner" is a pure configuration concern in
this repo: the runtime ships the backend, the apps register the tools, and
selecting AINDY_AGENT_PLANNER_BACKEND=runtime_local makes the planner produce
real plans over the registered tool catalog and a run get created + approved —
with no LLM and no edits to the runtime package.

Runs on the app-profile sqlite harness (no Postgres/Redis/Mongo required).

Scope note: the *execute* half of the loop (Nodus run -> syscall dispatch ->
tool side effects) requires the full Postgres schema (the runtime `agents`
table and friends) and belongs in the integration suite, run with
AINDY_AGENT_PLANNER_BACKEND=runtime_local against docker-compose.test.yml.
A live exercise of that path surfaced a runtime contract bug, pinned by the
xfail below.
