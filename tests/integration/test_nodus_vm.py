"""
RTR-1 §5 — validate the opt-in `nodus_vm` agent-execution backend with REAL app tools.

See HANDOFF-aindy-runtime-1.5.0.md §5 and .github/workflows/nodus-vm-integration.yml.

Why this suite exists
---------------------
The runtime validated `nodus_vm` end-to-end on Postgres, but ONLY with its own
runtime-native tools (`memory.recall`/`memory.write`). The open question — and the
last gate before `nodus_vm` could ever become the default — is whether tools
registered by THIS repo's plugin manifest resolve AND execute inside the
`nodus_worker` subprocess spawned by `NodusRuntimeAdapter`. That subprocess loads
tools via `_ensure_tools_loaded → load_plugins()`, which resolves the app manifest
relative to the subprocess cwd (the PLANNER-SUBPROC-1 risk class).

Crucially, `memory.recall`/`memory.write` are ALSO registered as runtime defaults
inside the subprocess, so a run over a memory tool can pass even if the app manifest
failed to load — masking the failure. To actually close the gate we must drive a tool
that ONLY the app manifest provides (`task.create`), which the runtime has no default
for. Gate 1 uses the deterministic `stub_app_tool` planner to emit exactly that step —
no LLM, key, or network. (It was previously LLM-driven via `anthropic_chat` to have
Claude *select* task.create, but that reduced Gate 1 to a `skip` in CI: the create-500
was an `anthropic.APIConnectionError` — the runner cannot reach api.anthropic.com — not
a code bug, and plan generation is in-process regardless of the execution backend, so an
LLM was never needed to prove subprocess app-tool execution. See TECH_DEBT
RTR-1-NODUS-APPTOOL-500.) The suite therefore needs no secret.

Run:
    docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
    pytest -c pytest.nodus.ini tests/integration/test_nodus_vm.py -v

History: execute-to-completion of a resumed nodus_vm segment was blocked by two stacked
runtime bugs, both PG-only (SQLite masked them) and both surfaced by driving the scheduler
in-process here:
  1. aindy-runtime#152 — ExecutionPipeline emitted its own execution.started BEFORE marking
     itself active, so the nested flow-runner pipeline tripped the ExecutionContract guard
     ('execution.started emitted outside pipeline'); the swallowed error poisoned the PG txn.
     Fixed in 1.5.2 (PR #155): set pipeline_active before the first emit.
  2. aindy-runtime#157 — with #152 cleared, the syscall dispatcher's idempotency gate cast
     the run-scoped execution_unit_id ('run_<uuid>') to the ExecutionUnit.id UUID column
     (InvalidTextRepresentation); the caught error, lacking a savepoint, poisoned the txn
     (InFailedSqlTransaction), so the flow_runs INSERT failed and the run never completed.
     Fixed in 1.5.3 (PR #158): only look up bare-UUID ids + SAVEPOINT/rollback the lookup.
With both fixed (pin floor >=1.5.3), the resumed segment runs to a terminal state, so Gate 2
hard-asserts completion. See TECH_DEBT RTR-1-NODUS-COMPLETION (RESOLVED).
