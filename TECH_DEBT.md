## LINT-VERSION-GAP-1: eslint trails @aindy/ui-kit by one major version

**Status:** Tracked, accepted. Schedule an upgrade pass when next doing maintenance work on this repo.

**Context:** `aindy-apps-monolith` is on `eslint@^9.36.0`. The `@aindy/ui-kit` library it consumes is on `eslint@^10.4.0`. Both use flat config; shared plugin overlap is `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` (this repo on `^5.2.0`, ui-kit on `^7.1.1` — independent version tracks).

**Posture:** Consumer trails library by one major version. The library's choice to lead is structurally correct; this entry is the consumer's side of the same finding.

**Cross-ref:** Same finding tracked in `aindy-runtime/TECH_DEBT.md` as LINT-VERSION-GAP-1 (runtime side, covering ui-kit).

**Upgrade scope when triggered:**
1. Bump `eslint` from `^9.36.0` to `^10.x` in `client/package.json`.
2. Verify `eslint-plugin-react-refresh@^0.4.22` is compatible with eslint 10 — this is the plugin most likely to require a coordinated bump.
3. Verify `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@^5.2.0` continues to work under eslint 10 (it should — react-hooks 5.x supports both eslint 9 and 10).
4. Verify the custom `no-restricted-syntax` rule enforcing `safeMap()` over `.map()` still parses under eslint 10's rule-config schema (flat config shape is stable across 9 → 10, low risk).
5. Run lint against the full `client/` source. Fix any new rule findings or silence with documented inline disables.

**Reopen trigger:** (a) any maintenance pass in this repo with budget for ~30 minutes of side-task work, OR (b) a desired ui-kit rule or react-hooks rule becomes eslint-10-only and back-pressures the upgrade.

**Estimated effort:** ~30 minutes assuming no plugin breakage. Add 30–60 minutes if `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` requires its own upgrade for compatibility.

**Out of scope for this entry:**
- Adopting `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@^7.x` is independent of the eslint version bump and should be evaluated separately. Hooks 7.x dropped support for eslint 8, so it's only available after this upgrade lands.
- Porting the `safeMap()` invariant to ui-kit was considered and rejected — ui-kit's `"strict": true` TypeScript config handles the bug class the rule guards in plain-JS apps-monolith code.
