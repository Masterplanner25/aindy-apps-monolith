# Server image for aindy-apps-monolith — the app profile *consuming* the published
# aindy-runtime framework.
#
# This is deliberately NOT a combined runtime+apps image. It installs the runtime as a
# pinned PyPI dependency (see pyproject.toml: aindy-runtime>=1.7.0,<2.0) and adds the
# app-profile deployment inputs this repo owns: the plugin manifest (aindy_plugins.json),
# the app bootstrap package (apps/), and the app-owned Alembic tree. At startup the runtime
# discovers ./aindy_plugins.json -> apps.bootstrap, which registers the 17 domain apps into
# the runtime via the plugin ABI.
#
# Shape follows the runtime's own `aindy-runtime init` scaffold (libpq-dev, AINDY_HOST=0.0.0.0,
# `aindy-runtime serve`), extended to install this app package so the runtime boots app-profile.
